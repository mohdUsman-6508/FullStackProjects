# MERN Stack Project

Welcome to this MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack project! This repository contains the source code for a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack.

## Overview

This project includes the following components:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing application data.
- **Express.js**: A Node.js web application framework used for building the server-side of the application.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library used for building the user interface and front-end components.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment used for running server-side code.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on data stored in the MongoDB database.
- **Responsive Design**: Create a responsive user interface that looks great on desktop and mobile devices.
- **State Management**: Use state management libraries like Redux or React Context API for managing application state.
- **RESTful APIs**: Design and implement RESTful APIs for client-server communication.
